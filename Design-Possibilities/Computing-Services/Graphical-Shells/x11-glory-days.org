* The X Window System Glory Days


** What is The X Window System

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System][The X Window System]] is a very effective and powerful way to run graphical
applications on modern computers where
- applications can be locate locally or on any computer across any network
- rendering of the graphics is done locally on the user's computer

The designers of /The X Window System/ ask that
- We either refer to /The X Window System/ by its full name
- or by the simple abbreviation /X/.
  
** The X Window System's Current Situation

The X Window System has been around for a long time
- The latest /X Network Protocol/ revision was Version X11 in 1987!
- Sometimes people use /X11/ to refer to /X/

While today's X works well
- Evolution of X has been neglected for decades!
      - X is a big system with lots of features and components
            - including a sophisticated extension mechanism
      - X met everyone's needs so completely for so long!
      - Major X components have been gradually lost due to neglect
      - /Today's X is a shadow of its former glory!/
- Recent effort has gone into replacing X11 with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)][Wayland protocol]]
      - Wayland has a much smaller vision than X had
      - Arguments that /Wayland/ is an advance over /X/ are dubious
            - X can be
                  - Restored to its full former glory
                  - Extended using its excellent extension mechanisms
                  - Evolved along with its protocol

** Awesome X Window System Features

Awesome features of C in its glory days
- Users could easily override application design
      - Most X Applications consisted of reconfigurable widgets
            - Users could easily change colors, layouts, text, etc.
            - User Preferences could be saved in the user's X Resource Database
                  - A simple textfile with pattern settings
                  - Suitable for manual or automatic editing
- Many features were provided by clients acting as servers
      - Fonts were provided by /Font Servers/
      - Color accuracy adjustments for were provided by /Color Servers/
      - Window management was provided by a user selected Window Manager
            - Dozens of window managers available for every taste
      - Fonts were provided by /Font Servers/
      - Any of these clients could run locally or remotely

** Clients vs. Servers

What's this confusion of
- /Local Servers/
- /Local and Remote Clients/
- /Clients acting as Servers/
- etc.?

It turns out that /Client/ and /Server/ are =roles= which programs can play.

A Server is any program which
- provides some service for other programs
- has a method for being contacted by clients
      - e.g. an ip address, protocol and port number

A program can provide services for its clients while receiving services from
other programs.

A common use of a Server Program is to manage a resource
- A /Display/ resource consists of any and all graphical Input/Output devices
      - Screens, Keyboard, Pointers, Touch devices, etc.
- In X, the X Server owns and provides high-level access to the /Display/

Since the /Display/ hardware is where the /User/ is
- the /X Server/ is local

X Clients can be local or remote
- Clients connect to the X Server managing the User's Display
      - Application clients interact with the User
      - Service Clients make themselves available to the other clients

Using /X/ helped many computer experts grasp these important distinctions!

** Why X is now sometimes slow
