* Constructive Criticism of Current Systems

We live in a world filled with flawed design. The consequences of flawed design
is that the quality (and length) of every one of our lives is significantly
diminished.

A design can be flawed because
- It poorly implements its design concept
      - Unreliable
      - Hard to use
      - Exhibiting poor performance
      - Burdened with unnecessary complexity
      - Difficult to adapt, evolve or build on
- It only implements part of its design concept
      - Full implementation was postponed until later
      - "Later" never came
      - Awkward workarounds replaced original vision.
- It's design concept is flawed
- It's design concept is unnecessarily limited

All flawed designs offer an opportunity for good creative designers to correct
or supply what's missing. Unfortunately, there is usually
- great difficulty in getting partnership in these enterprises
- significant friction in the acceptance of these solutions
In other words, poor design and missing design is usually not an accident!

None of these obstacles should be used as an excuse to not move ahead. They just
mean that these opportunities must be approached with skill and resources. Skill
and resources which good creative designers might not have. This can be
frustrating!

The Issues in this collection are an intended to identify design flaws which can
potentially be followed up with corrective action.
