* Issues Inherited From The History Of Computing

The world "computer" originally referred to human beings who solved problems by
performing calculations. Automatic computers only gained the ability to put
"human computers" out of business towards the second half of the 20th century.

** The First General-Purpose Electronic Computer?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC][ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), the first programmable,
electronic, general-purpose digital computer, was completed in 1945.

- cost :: $487,000 (equivalent to $6,900,000 in 2023)
- memory capacity :: 20 10-digit decimal numbers (registers)
- weight :: 27,215 kg (60,000 pounds)
- power consumption :: 150 kW
- processing speed :: any of
      - 5,000 addition or subtraction operations per second between any 2 registers
      - 385 multiplication operations per second
      - 40 division operations per second
      - 3 division operations per second
      - some operations could be done in parallel using different registers

But despite being "programmable", ENIAC lacked electronic storage for its programs!

You had to change its wiring to change its program!

The ability (and often necessity) to change the wiring of the early computers
delayed the understanding of how to design a good and complete set of built-in
operations. Early computers often had very poorly thought-out "instruction sets"
because of the early casual adding of new instructions (primitive operations)
through rewiring.

** The First General-Purpose Stored-Program Electronic Computers

From the Victoria University of Manchester, England emerged
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby][Manchester Baby]] 1948 :: the first computer which could store its program in electronic memory.
      - Considered a clumsy prototype.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Mark_1][Manchester Mark 1]] 1949 :: the successor to the Manchester Baby.
      - A better prototype.  Used for almost 2 years as a practical tool.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1][Manchester Farranti Mark 1]] :: the world's first commercially available
  electronic general-purpose stored program digital computer.
      - "the tidied up and commercialised version of the Manchester Mark I"
      - produced by British electrical engineering firm Ferranti Ltd.

** Change the Scale and your Change the Nature

Over the next few decades digital electronic computers went through a rapid
evolution.  Each new generation had
- great increases in the generality of operations
- massive increases in computational speed
- vast increases in memory capacity
- extraordinary decreases in cost and bulk

When the scale of something changes, the nature of that thing changes.
- an elephant is not a scaled-up ant.
- a car is not a scaled-up bicycle
- a modern computer /shouldn't be/ a scaled-up ENIAC

But (partially because of how fast things changed) each computer generation
inherited a number of design features from earlier generations which should
instead have been discarded.

*** Digital Computers: Before the First Generation

Mechanical computing devices go back thousands of years before ENIAC. But the
idea of programmable digital devices is more recent.

Before ENIAC we had

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus][Lambda Calculus]] :: an elegant and complete theory of computation
      - invented by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church][Alonzo Church]] during the 1930s, published in 1940
- the electro-mechanical computers designed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse][Konrad Zuse]]
      - the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_(computer)][Z1]] (1935) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z2_(computer)][Z2]] (1945)
      - Zuse also invented the first high-level computer programming language!
- the extraordinary work of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing][Alan Turing]], a student of Alonzo Churge
      - invented the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine][Turing Machine]] (and so much more) in 1936
      - contributed to the secret /British Collossus computers/ in 1943-1945
      - designed the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) in 1945

There were obstacles preventing this early work from going forward:
- The early electronic computers seemed too limited to follow the Lambda
  Calculus model.
- Germany's role in World War II and the subsequent chaos prevented Zuze's work
  from being known to the world until it was largely obsolete.
- Britain lost their early lead in electronic computing by keeping much of the
  technology a military secret and by persecuting Alan Turing for his
  homosexuality.

*** Digital Computers: The First Generation

Despite being guided by many extraordinary mathematicians, especially including
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann][John von Neumann,]] the design of the first generation of Programmable
General-Purpose Electronic Digital Computers was an inelegant, ad hoc hack.

- A small set of unique and often strange operations
- A few electronic /registers/ which could each hold a single number
- A modest amount of magnetic core memory which could hold 

These early computers were given

*** 20th Century Hardware Limitations Have Warped Our Perspectives

Common Computing Equipment was severely limited in capacity, especially memory
capacity, throughout the 20th Century. This greatly affected the design of the
/C Programming Language/ and the /Unix Operating System/ which have been the
primary models for computer architectures and operating systems to this day.

Late 20th Century Minicomputers
- DEC PDP-11 Minicomputer
      - Primary hardware influencing the development of Unix
      - Produced from 1970 to 1990
      - Cost: $20,000 with 4K (4,096) bytes of memory
            - approximately $140,000 in 2024 dollars
            - Used [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory][Magnetic-core memory]]
                  - Magnetic-Core Memory was more than 100,000 times as costly
                    as today's semiconductor RAM
                  - Semiconductor RAM was even more expensive then!
      - 16-bit words
      - Maximum addressable memory: 64Ki - 8Ki (57,344) bytes
            - 8Ki bytes reserved for I/O
            - Some later PDP-11 models allowed for 18-bit physical memory
                  - 253,952 bytes total
                  - only 57,344 addressable at once
                  - these models were much more expensive!
      - A large hard drive might have 10 MiB (megabytes)
      - With [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing][timesharing]], a high-end PDP-11 could support dozens of simultaneous
        users, depending on what they were doing
      - No networking!
- DEC VAX model 780
      - Successor to DEC PDP-11
      - Cost: around $1,000,000 1980 dollars
      - Influenced evolution of Unix and BSD Operating Systems
            - Virtual Memory (BSD Design)
            - Networking (BSD Design)
                  - 3 Mbps Ethernet
                  - Socket Networking Model
                  - Original prototype of TCP/IP, the modern Internet Protocol, etc.
            - BSD = Berkeley Software Distribution
            - Berkeley = the University of California's Berkeley Campus
      - 32-bit words
            - Maximum addressable memory: 64Ki - 8Ki (57,344) bytes
            - Typically equipped with 2-8 Mi bytes of main memory
                  - Semiconductor RAM was more than 10,000 times as costly as
                    today's Semiconductor RAM.
      - A large hard drive might have 40 MiB (megabytes)
      - With [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing][timesharing]], a single VAX 70 could support 50 or more simultaneous
        users, depending on what they were doing

Late 20th Century Microprocessor-Based Computers
- Sun Workstation
      - The Sun-2 (1983) had similar specs to a DEC Vax/780 minicomputer
            - Typically provisioned with 1-2 MiB of RAM
      - Used the BSD Operating System
      - Had a graphics display of 1 million pixels!
      - Cost: US$29,300 (equivalent to $69,000 in 2023
      - Helped define the original concept of a workstation as
            - 1 million instructions per second
            - 1 million pixels of bitmapped graphics display
            - 1 megabit per second networking
            - 10 or more megabytes of disk
      - With [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing][timesharing]] could support multiple users not using graphics
      - Intended to support only one user using a Graphical Desktop
- Most contemporary microcomputer systems were much less powerful!
      - The IBM PC and Apple 3 were less than 1/10th as powerful
      - but they were even cheaper!
