* Emacs Rant

** What's an Emacs?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]] began at the seminal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory#Project_MAC][MIT Project MAC]] as a simple (but extensible)
collection of macros to make editing text files easier.

Emacs inspired many later text editors which were even
- more powerful
- more customizable
- more extensible

Eventually one Emacs rose above the rest
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][GNU/Emacs]]
primarily because of
- the thousands powerful extensions for it created by
- its vibrant, creative user community

Gnu/Emacs became much more than just a tool for editing text

Gnu/Emacs is a
- Front end for hundreds of powerful applications
- Personal and Project Manager
- Information hub for communication
- Smart assistant for programming in hundreds of computer languages
- /and much more/

** Text vs. Datbases as the Master Medium

-- Move this to the Files vs Database RANT!!!

One of Alan Perlis' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigrams_on_Programming][Epigrams]] says that
- "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10
  functions on 10 data structures."

Data exists both inside and outside computer programs.
- Data inside of programs is usually in a very specialized form
      - Hard to get at except through the custom code of that program
- Data outside of programs can be in general or specialized formats

There are two general and flexible formats for representing data outside of
programs
- Human readable text
      - Containing expressions in natural and/or artificial languages
      - Often with additional markups
- General-Purpose Databases
      - Usually Relational Databases
      - Usually supporting the SQL standard

Text is the
- easiest to set up on any computer system
- easiest to get started using
- can gradually support extremely sophisticated

data structures which can store nearly all forms
of information outside of programs.

Text files turn out to be one of the easiest representations for
- documents of all kinds
      - books, articles, calendars, planning documents, etc.
- representing data and information
- control scripts for operating systems
- code in multiple programming languages
- /and much more!/

Many people place text files at the center of their creative work and use tools
like ~git~ to share and collaborate with partners.

Emacs is
- the most powerful
extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor
