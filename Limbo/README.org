** Intentions for this Repository

I'm in the process of collecting my diverse notes on the design of various
entities, services, systems, etc. here.

These notes will include
- Constructive Criticism of existing designs
- Ideas for improving existing systems
- Ideas for new systems

These notes are intended to be *constructive* in two senses:
- Intended to be used to *improve* things
- Intended to be used to *build* things
