(1) Have an ironny emoji that is not removable
(2) When heuristics think something is false or misleading,
offer the poster the option of attaching the irony emoji or a
maybe-dubious emoji, the latter until its been reviewed
(3) Sharing option that allows resharing only along friend links,
one level at a time - no global exposure.
(4)  Can attach unremovable irony or dubious emojis at any level which
if frequent, can maybe lead to review of original and addition of such to all
