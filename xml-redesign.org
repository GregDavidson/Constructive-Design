* XML and HTML Improvement Notes

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML][XML]], the eXtensible Markup Language and its famous variant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] are widely used
yet they fall short of what would be possible with a refresh of their designs.

XML is a metalanguage which allows users to define domain-specific variants.

XML
- Used for Microsoft Office document storage.
- Used by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice][LibreOffice]] and other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument][OpenDocument]] tools.
- Was once very popular for web services and configuration files.
      - Now largely avoided for this purpose.

HTML, XHTML, HTML5 for Web Pages
- HTML was originally a somewhat nonstandard variant of XML
- XHTML format was a proper XML language
      - XML tools could help write, verify and process XHTML content.
- HTML5 has replaced XHTML with another nonstandard variant of XML
      - HTML5 is a suite of technologies going well beyond HTML.
      - All of these technologies lack standards.
      - They are simply defined by what popular browsers do.

It is possible to
- Make XML both simpler and better.
- Make HTML a properly defined, standard XML language.

**  Namespace URIs --> URLs of modular specs

** Tag Properties by Namespace & Class

A namespace qualifying a Tag would extend over the attributes unless those
attributes are explicitly namespace qualified.

The global default namespace replaces the doctype.

Attribute values wouldn't need quotes if they were free of special characters.

Classes and Attributes would use something like CSS Selector Notation:

=<span#id[x=10].special[x=foo]>=
- The first =x= is associated with the tag =span=.
- The second =x= is associated with the class =special=.

   Attributes would be associated with the tag, but usually would be
   associated with a class name.

** Elements are /always/ closed

** Character entities are replaced by
