* Our Tools Are Often Getting Stupider!

By Tools we include
- Our phones and other end-user computer devices
      - sometimes their hardware
      - usually their software
            - especially apps (Application Programs)
- Increasingly our other tools
      - Cars
      - Domestic appliances
      - Domestic appliances

In general, knowledge of how to make everything better is increasing rapidly!
We are much better able to make all products with
- improved functionality
- increased reliability
- lower cost
- less negative environmental impact

Yet at the same time
1. A lot of knowledge and understanding is being lost
       - because of the retirement and death of scholars practitioners
       - because of the loss or obscurity of key information
             - technical reports and documentation
             - source code repositories
             - etc.
2. A lot of things are getting stupider
       - mostly driven by win-lose decisions
             - encouraging mindshare lock-in
             - minimizing end-user customization and extension capability
       - sometimes because of the loss of knowledge and understanding
 
- regressions :: functionality removed and not available in other ways.

There are diverse motivations for /regressions/
- making systems more predictable and centrally controllable
      - despite the loss of user freedom and power user productivity
- making customers more dependent
      - features exclusively available from a sole proprietary provider
      - customization is available for a large fee for major customers
- popular movements which reduce functionality
      - Restyling everything with, e.g. /material design/
      - Requirement of Graphical or Menu-Driven Interfaces
            - No command language or scriptability
      - Downloading all presentations as bitmaps
            - Fonts, contrast, placement all fixed
            - No local rendering

*** Apple Devices

All Apple devices with the exception of their Macintosh general-purpose
computers, i.e. iPads and iPhones are designed to be stupid. They can only run
programs "apps" from the Apple App Store. Those apps must be approved by Apple
and Apple prohibits any apps which are user programmable or significantly user
extensible.
